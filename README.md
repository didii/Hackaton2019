# Hackaton2019

For this hackaton we tried simulating the universe.
In about 24h, we had the following features:

* Flyable spaceship in space
  * Although the movement is still buggy (forward is on a fixed axis and doesn't rotate with the ship)
  * Controls are:
    * WS: forward/backward
    * AD: strafe left/right
    * QE: move up/down
    * IK: rotate up/down
    * JL: rotate left/right
    * UO: roll left/right
* Planets and suns
* Density/mass
* Kinematics
* Gravity
* Collision
  * The smallest planet will disappear
  * The biggest planet will absorb the smaller one
